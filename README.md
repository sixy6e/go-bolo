# go-bolo

A hobby project to port the WinBolo game to Go.

WinBolo was a fun game I used to play in highschool many many moons ago.
This is purely a fun hobby, learning and discovery project to recreate the
WinBolo game in the Go language.

You can find details about WinBolo, along with a few screenshots at:
